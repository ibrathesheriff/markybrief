    <h1>6 Useful Text Summarization Algorithm in Python</h1>
<p>Are you fascinated by the magic of Python algorithms that can distill vast oceans of text into concise, insightful summaries? By the end of this journey, you’ll wield the power to transform lengthy articles, research papers, and documents into concise, digestible gems. Let’s code our way to effective communication and knowledge extraction!</p>

<h2>Extractive Text Summarization</h2>
<p>As the name implies, extractive text summarizing ‘extracts’ significant information from enormous amounts of text and arranges it into clear and succinct summaries. The approach is simple in that it extracts texts based on factors such the text to be summarized, the most essential sentences (Top K), and the importance of each of these phrases to the overall subject.</p>

<h2>Abstractive Text Summarization</h2>
<p>Abstractive text summarization creates readable sentences from the complete text input. Although it is not as straightforward to utilize as the extractive technique, abstract summary is significantly more beneficial in many cases. This is not to say that extractive summarization is unnecessary.</p>

<h2>6 techniques for text summarization in Python</h2>
<p>Here are five approaches to text summarization using both abstractive and extractive methods. Here are five approaches to text summarization using both abstractive and extractive methods.</p>

<h3>1. SUMY</h3>
<p>Sumy is a library and command line utility for extracting summary from HTML pages or plain texts. It provides several algorithms for summarization including LSA, Luhn, Edmundson, and more.</p>

<h3>2. BERT Extractive Summarization</h3>
<p>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) can also be used for extractive summarization, where sentences are ranked based on their importance and the top sentences form the summary. The bert-extractive-summarizer library provides a simple interface for BERT-based extractive summarization.</p>

<h3>3. BART Abstractive Summarization</h3>
<p>In addition to extractive summarization, BART can also be used for abstractive summarization. Here’s how you can use BART for abstractive summarization using the transformers library.</p>

<h3>4. T5 Abstractive Summarization</h3>
<p>T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a versatile transformer model that can be applied to various NLP tasks, including summarization. Here’s how you can use T5 for abstractive summarization using the transformers library.</p>

<h3>5. Gensim</h3>
<p>Gensim is a Python library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis. It also provides a simple implementation of TextRank, an unsupervised algorithm based on graph theory.</p>

<h3>6. TextTeaser</h3>
<p>TextTeaser is an automatic summarization algorithm that takes an article and provides a summary. First, you’ll need to make an API request to generate a summary. But in theory, AI-based summarizers will prove better in the long run as they will constantly learn and provide superior results.</p>
